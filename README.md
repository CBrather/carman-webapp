# Running the App

For the App to run successfully, an auth0 tenant needs to be setup and a _public/config.js_ file setting _window.env_ to a value of type EnvironmentConfig with valid values from auth0 set for the respective fields.

Locally it can then be running via vite, using `npm run dev` for hot-reloading, or `npm run preview` to run it in vite's preview mode.
